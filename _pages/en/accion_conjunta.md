As a result of the joint work of the different Central Statistical Bodies of the Autonomous Communities (OCECAS), a series of associated indicators have been defined 
to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals whose statistical series are harmonized and comparable between the different autonomies and with respect to state value. 

In 2019, in order to carry out coordinated work in the development of the indicators of the autonomous communities, a working group was established. 
between the statistical organizations of the autonomous communities, in the form of a collaborative network, with the aim of agreeing on the methodology for calculating the indicators 
of the United Nations for the autonomous communities, seeking alternatives to problems of territorialization or relevance and guaranteeing, in any case, comparability. 

After intense work, each autonomous community has a common and homogeneous battery of indicators and a standard methodological sheet that statistical organizations. 
They will disseminate on their respective web pages.
